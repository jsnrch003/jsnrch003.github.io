# my-odinproject-google-page

Here it is, my first HTML/CSS project. 

I've only just begun to code!

But seriously, I'm starting out teaching myself for now through online resources like Codecademy, Team Treehouse, Odin Project and FreeCodeCamp. My goal is to make a career change in the next year after getting some projects built for a portfolio. 

Wish me luck!
