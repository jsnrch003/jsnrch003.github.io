# my-odinproject-google-page

Here it is, my first HTML/CSS project. 

I've only just begun to code!

But seriously, I'm starting out teaching myself for now through online resources like Codecademy, Team Treehouse, Odin Project and FreeCodeCamp. I currently work full time but I may look for a part time boot camp in the future. 

My goal is to make a career change in the next year after getting some projects built for a portfolio.

Wish me luck!
